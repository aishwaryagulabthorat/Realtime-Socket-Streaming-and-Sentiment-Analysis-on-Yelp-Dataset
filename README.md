# Realtime-Socket-Streaming-and-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Yelp-Dataset
🚀 We built a scalable ETL pipeline using AWS S3, Glue, Athena, SageMaker, and Kafka, Spark for sentiment analysis &amp; real-time processing. Applied ML, LSH, Bloom Filters, K-Anonymity for insights &amp; privacy. Huge learning in Big Data &amp; Cloud! 🚀 #AI #BigData #AWS #ML

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing a scalable and efficient data processing pipeline to analyze Yelp business, review, and tip data using AWS cloud services. The pipeline integrates AWS S3, AWS Glue, AWS Athena, and AWS SageMaker to process large-scale unstructured data and perform sentiment analysis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Cloud Services:** AWS S3, AWS Glue, AWS Athena, AWS SageMaker
- **Big Data Processing:** Apache Spark, PySpark, Kafka
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Streaming Algorithms:** Bloom Filter, Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
- **Privacy Techniques:** K-Anonymity, Differential Privacy

## ⚙️ System Architecture
The project evolved through two architectures:
1. **Initial Approach:** Implemented TCP/IP socket streaming, Apache Spark, Kafka, and OpenAI’s LLM API for real-time sentiment analysis.
2. **Optimized AWS-Based Approach:** Migrated to AWS for scalable ETL processing and machine learning model training.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Streaming:** Implemented real-time streaming using Kafka and Spark Streaming.
- **ETL Pipeline:** Transformed raw JSON data into Parquet format for efficient querying.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Applied Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization for text classification.
- **Advanced Querying:** Used AWS Athena to derive business insights through complex SQL queries.
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** Implemented K-Anonymity and Differential Privacy to protect user data.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Improved data querying performance using Parquet format.
- Conducted sentiment analysis with 79% accuracy.
- Used streaming algorithms to efficiently process large-scale Yelp data.
- Leveraged AWS services to reduce cost and improve scalability.
